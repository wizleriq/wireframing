# wireframing
## Introduction

Wireframing is a critical step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating a basic visual representation or blueprint of a web page, application, or system. Wireframes outline the structure, layout, and functionality of a product without focusing on design elements such as colors, fonts, or graphics.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframes serve as the foundation for building digital products. They help designers, developers, and stakeholders:

- **Visualize the structure** of a page or application before any code is written.
- **Identify usability issues** early in the design process.
- **Communicate ideas** clearly among team members and clients.
- **Save time and resources** by allowing rapid iteration and feedback.
